        <h1>Elephants in the Room</h1>
        <p>In a surprising turn of events, ads have become Big Tech’s Achilles’ heel. Google’s ad revenue grew just 3% this quarter, down from 43% growth a year ago. For the first time, YouTube ad revenue...</p>

        <h1>The Joys of Being Wrong About Yourself</h1>
        <p> Rupert is proof that it’s never too late to find a new source of awe/ that when you find something you love, you don’t care how silly it makes you look or what other people think about it/ that perhaps everyday life is full of untapped passion, and should I be excited by all the potentialities, or depressed that ...</p>

        <p>In the pall of first quarantine, the grocery-washing, Deborah Birx evenings, quiet but for distant sirens, while others in the house attended iPad school or Zoom subcommittees, I played speed chess online. Three-minute games, mostly. Sometimes one-minute games...</p>

        <h1>Living Boundaries</h1>
        <p>Our boundaries are often created in response to specific external conditions. Maybe it was because a person or a situation is causing us a lot of distress. It worked. The problem is, time moved on.</p>

        <h1>How Old is Old?</h1>
        <p>When you were in your 20s or 30s, what age seemed “old” and what did you imagine it’d be like to be “old”? And what do you think about being older now?</p>

        <h1>“There is magic in the trying and learning and trying again...</h1>
        <p>I like being a second-time founder.It’s like having your second kid. You don’t sweat the small stuff because you know what the small stuff actually is. You feel more confident in your instincts and rely on your gut more than your hyperactive mind and what other hyperactive minds around you tell you.</p>

        <h1>The End of the Road to Serfdom</h1>
        <p>For most of the modern era, most people in the rich world have been poor, just like their parents and their children. Social mobility was more dream than reality. Most people were born to serve, as were their children.</p>

        <h1>Living And Dying In The Attention Economy</h1>
        <p>Everybody wants to be seen. The drive is unavoidably hammered into our DNA. But capturing anyone’s attention, even for a moment, is quite the challenge these days. So, it’s no surprise to see the extremes people go to satisfy this hard-wired need.</p>
